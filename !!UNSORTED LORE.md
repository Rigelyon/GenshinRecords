Oh yes, I should explain something about the Fortress of Meropide first Because it's not simply just the "prison" of Fontaine

7:29

Nominally, it isn't under the jurisdiction of Fontaine's legal systems, and has always existed as an autonomous entity 

12:12

Yes, Neuvillette left a deep impression on me He's a just and impartial judge

12:18

And also extremely powerful, with an unfathomable aura Actually many people in Fontaine have this impression of Neuvillette

12:27

So they regard him with awe and veneration As the Iudex of Fontaine Neuvillette presides over Fontaine's judicial system, and maintains the principles of impartiality

12:37

Both when he's in court And in his everyday life, he's constantly aware of his public influence

12:42

For example, he tries to avoid forming personal relationships or even collaborating with others outside of established procedures To prevent the impartiality of the judiciary from being called into question

12:49

He sets extremely high standards for himself The kind of strict self-discipline you'd expect from a Chief Justice

12:55

That's right But this Iudex isn't just the solemn figure that everyone imagines

13:00

He also has his own interests and personal life For instance, one of Neuvillette's hobbies is water tasting

13:06

Although he barely ever gets the chance to leave Fontaine He's tasted famous springwater that's been sent in from all over the world

13:14

After tasting it, he also expresses his opinions on the drinking water from different regions For example, he finds water from Mondstadt to be crisp and pure

13:21

Water from Liyue to have an enduring aftertaste, and so on I always thought that only tea could be tasted in this way

13:26

I hadn't expected Neuvillette to be able to differentiate so many different flavors in regular water You learn something new every day, huh?

13:32

Neuvillette has a public persona But he also has a private one He loves the Melusines deeply, and sees them as a lovely, gentle race of beings

13:42

Neuvillette even added the following intriguing law to Fontaine's books: "Melusines are to be addressed using she/her pronouns, never the impersonal it/its"

13:52

That's a side of the Chief Justice that you wouldn't have expected But it's true that the Melusines are lovely creatures I can really understand where he's coming from

13:58

There's actually a special detective force that reports directly to the Iudex, known as the "Marechaussee Phantom"

14:04

The vast majority of its employees are Melusines This isn't simply favoritism on Neuvillette's part

14:09

The powerful sight of the Melusines enables them to see what human beings cannot perceive

14:14

So they're able to help Neuvillette gather all kinds of evidence for his trials But of course, this means that the Melusines who work for the Marechaussee Phantom are often targeted by criminals[^1]
